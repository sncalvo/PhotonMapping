# Whitted Renderer

## How to run

In your OS of choice run premake5 with the corresponding action

```
./premake5 gmake
./premake5 vs2019
./premake5 xcode4
```

This will generate in the build folder the project for you to work in your favourite OS (or IDE).

## :warning: Warnings
The gitignore file is still very primitive

Have not tested this in windows yet

Will have to see if libraries work out of the box or something else is needed for linking
